# WindowGrid

Free software allowing for quick and easy resize and layout window management. 

Unfortunately the software seems to be abandoned for the most part as last commit by the creator were done in 2016. As of today (2022) WindowGrid still works without issues.
## Resize

## Setup

1. Download the zip file
2. Unpack the zip file to whatever localization suits you
3. You can either use it as portable app, that will need your action on every windows startup or install it and allow it to start with system startup.
