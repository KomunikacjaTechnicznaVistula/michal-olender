# What is window management software?

Window management software is what allows us as users to take advantage of either limited space in case of single monitor setups, or of too much space in case of multi-monitor setups.

Such software allows to resize applications so they can fit perfectly to your desire, it is especially useful when you need to use 2 or more things at once.
For example when you need to delve into multiple excel spreadsheets at once.
